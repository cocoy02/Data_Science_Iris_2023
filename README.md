# Data_Science_Iris_2023

## Motivation
A garden owner would like to examine the distinctiveness of different Iris flower classes (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica) in his garden based on historical data measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). With understanding of the differences, heâ€™d also like to create a tool with help from a top data scientist to quickly retrieve records of the most similar Iris flowers in his garden for any input Iris flower.
